              <br/>
              <p><h3><ul>
				  <li>Create a <strong>demo, prototype or application</strong> that analyses and/or makes use of linked data for any kind of online learning.</li>
				  <li>In your application, you <strong>use data sets</strong> from the LinkedUp data repository and/or data from other sources.</li>
				  <li>Provide information about your application in several evaluation criteria, such as intended audience and the usability of your application. This will be asked on the submission form.</li>
				  <li>Write an abstract of about 200 words describing your application and its goals. This abstract will be published on the LinkedUp website after acceptance.</li>
				  <li>The demo should be available to the review panel. A publicly available demo or even open source code would be a plus, but is not required.</li>
				  <li>The submission form will launch in April. Please <a href="#contact">stay tuned</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/okfn.org/forms/d/1DAK4dM5ET-OopQVx105MJJdPXC_bTfESM8SsDvFe0dE/viewform" target="_blank">register your interest</a> in the meantime.</li>

              <p><h3>First of all, there are cash prizes. Out of a total prize budget of 39.500 EUR the Veni Competition offers:<br />
			  <br />
			  <ul>
			  <li>1st prize: 2.000 EUR</li>
			  <li>2nd and 3rd prize: 1.000 EUR each</li>
			  <li>5 Runner-up prizes with a total value of 1.000 EUR</li>
			  </ul></h3></p>
			  <p><h3>More importantly, there are the opportunities for networking and promoting your application to a wide audience:
			  <br />
			  <br />
			  <ul>
			  <li><strong>Showcase</strong> your ideas and solutions to the key community of researchers and practitioners in the educational field. The competition committee consists of well-known people from industry and academia. The accepted submissions and demos will be widely disseminated. Last but not least the results will be presented at <a href="http://okcon.org" target="_blank">OKCon</a>.</li>
			  <li><strong>Establish contact</strong> with a network of professional major organisations. Draw attention to your services, products, company or research activities with your submission by participating in the growing LinkedUp community.</li>
			  <li>Deploy and evaluate your applications in <strong>real-world settings</strong>. LinkedUp offers a set of challenging use cases from real world large organizations, and stakeholders from e-learning (Commonwealth of Learning), publishing (Elsevier) and edutainment (Jake Berger, BBC). Your submission could provide them with solutions that they need.</li>
			  <li>Work with a <strong>large amount of linked datasets</strong>, collected and provided by LinkedUp. The LinkedUp dataset provides a convenient starting point for exploring well-described educational and non-educational data on the Web.</li>
			  <li>Benefit from <strong>dedicated support and guidance</strong> offered by LinkedUp. We have a team of people who are eager to support you. We will provide 'cooking recipes' and other kinds of documentation. Contact us with specific questions. You can even submit your code for technical support.</li>
			  <li>Use the LinkedUp dataset for your experiments and publications. Apart from your submission to the competition, we encourage you to continue the work and to submit it to conferences and other events.</li>

			  <p><h3>To support the challenge, the LinkedUp support action is collecting and cataloguing data explicitly related to education, as well as related data that may be relevant. This includes data about open educational resources, course programmes and educational facilities. Related data may included data about useful Web media, user-generated content, Web lectures or academic publications. The results from the intial efforts focus on explicitly educational data. The <a href="http://datahub.io/group/linked-education" target="_blank">Linked Education catalogue</a> is available, as well as through a <a href="http://data.linkededucation.org/linkedup/catalog/" target="_blank">data endpoint</a>, where a SPARQL endpoint provides access to VoID descriptions of currently included datasets.

			  <p><h3>Through the Linked Education data repository, as well as upcoming development support facilities including code samples, use case documentation, code clinics and a developers forum, the LinkedUp support action will provide a complete environment to ensure great, highly exploitable applications are generated from putting together the best developers with all the data they need to create new educational services.</h3></p>

              <p><h3>The data and support infrastructure are a continuous work in progress and updates are provided as we go. We are in particular planning substantial updates/releases according to the following schedule.
			  <ul>
			    <li><strong>end-March 2013:</strong> Expanded Linked Education catalogue with significant amount of OER metadata exposed as linked data. Launch of the “LinkedUp DevTalk” blog/forum.</li>
				<li><strong>end-April 2013:</strong> Release of the Linked Education tagset for cataloguing education-related datasets, and inclusion of datasets useful for student modelling. Opening of the code clinic environment.</li>
				<li><strong>end-May 2013:</strong> Release of advanced interfaces to the catalogue, including search and navigation facilities, and inclusion of datasets regarding statistics in education, courses and academic programmes.</li>

               <h1>Open data applied to education</h1>
               <br/><br/>
			   <p><h3>LinkedUp seeks to explore and exploit the wealth of web data for education. This includes data with an explicit educational purpose, as well as other data and information that may not have an explicit educational remit, but can usefully be applied to an educational context.</h3></p>
               <p><h3>Linked data principles and techniques are used successfully to expose and link datasets from a large variety of resources, covering government, media, life sciences and user-generated content. The cloud of linked data is rapidly growing. Still, there is much more potential for users and society to benefit from widespread access to openly available data.</h3></p>
			   <p><h3>Education is an area that is expected to benefit highly from linked data approaches. Many institutes offer Open Educational Resources (OER) online. Famous examples include <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm" target="_blank">MIT Open CourseWare</a> and the UK Open University's <a href="http://www.open.edu/openlearn/" target="_blank">OpenLearn</a>. Linked data makes it possible to connect the various offerings with one another and with general-purpose resources such as Wikipedia.</h3></p>
			   <p><h3>The field of Learning Analytics focuses on the use of intelligent data, learner-produced data and analysis models to discover information and social connections, and to predict and advise on learning. In the LinkedUp challenges we highly appreciate findings, aggregations, visualizations and other results that pave the way to novel tools that make use of open educational and general-purpose Web resources.</h3></p>
