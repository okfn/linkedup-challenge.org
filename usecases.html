              <p><h3><img align="right" src="images/col.png" height="175px" />The <a href="http://www.col.org" target="_blank">Commonwealth of Learning</a> (COL) is an intergovernmental organization created by the Commonwealth Heads of Government to encourage the development and sharing of open learning and distance education knowledge, resources and technologies. COL is helping developing nations improve access to quality education and training.</h3></p>
                          
                          <p><h3>The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of more than 50 independent sovereign states, which provide support to each other, and work together toward international goals.</h3></p>
                          
                          <h2>Context</h2>
              <p><h3>The use case addresses educational challenges in developing countries, with limited money to invest in education, but a strong need for high quality learning materials.</h3></p>
                          
                          <p><h3>COL’s work and research suggests that most of higher education students have internet access at their colleges, and half of them at home as well. They are proficient in English, and skilled at manipulating social media tools such as YouTube. They usually use and discuss OERs on social media channels, while many of their teachers do not use or fully appreciate the value of such tools.</h3></p>

                          <h2>Problem</h2>
              <p><h3>Teachers can access a potentially huge amount of OERs from the internet but it takes time to analyze and evaluate each resource one by one to judge if and how much they fit a learning programme. What could be beneficial for them would be the ability to extract information about the usefulness and attractiveness of learning materials from social media , including learners’ activities, such as rating, liking, and commenting.</h3></p>
          
              <p><h3>The need highlighted by this use case is the one to leverage social media in order to establish the true relevance and value of a resource by analysing the personalized, enriched educational content of social learners. This would allow a first screening of learning materials and would simplify teachers’ evaluation of resources. This simplified evaluation should be based mainly on three parameters:<br />
                          <br />
                          <ul>
                          <li>location of information</li>
                          <li>educational value</li>
                          <li>social appreciation</li>
                          </ul></h3></p>

                          <h2>Data sets</h2>
              <p><h3>The data sets analyzed in this use case are comprised of learner inputs on OERs posted to YouTube and Facebook in the form of ratings, likes and comments. These inputs can be parsed and aggregated to establish a measure of value for each resource and its utility for learners. The educational resources will be provided via the <a href="http://doer.col.org" target="_blank">Directory of Open Educational Resources</a>. Subject matter will be full courses at UG level in areas of physical sciences, engineering and technology.</h3></p>

                          <p><h3><img align="right" src="images/elsevier.png" />At the same time also the project partner Elsevier expressed very similar interests. Elsevier is a world-leading provider of scientific, technical and medical information products and services. The company works in partnership with the global science and health communities to publish more than 2,000 journals, including The Lancet and Cell, and close to 20,000 book titles, including major reference works from Mosby and Saunders. Elsevier also provides several online solutions such as ScienceDirect and Scopus.</h3></p>

                          <p><h3>The fact that similar needs and interests were expressed by so different and relevant parties strengthens the relevance of the use case.</h3></p>
                          
                          <h2>Context</h2>
              <p><h3>Most data and media is not explicitly ‘educational’, but much of it has potential for use in education and research if surfaced in the relevant educational context, and described using terms that are recognised and meaningful to the user.</h3></p>
                          
                          <p><h3>Let’s imagine an instructor who would like to create a course curriculum using open Web data to address an emerging interdisciplinary topic. She opens the Educationizer web app and types a few subject of her curriculum-specific categories into the search field. The app retrieves numerous relevant results, from a range of linked data sets, and clusters them into categories that she recognises, and that are aligned with her course needs, having ‘mapped’ the unfamiliar categories to ones that she can work with.</h3></p>

                          <p><h3>The material would include content and training materials from European non-profits, open data sets, statistics, published reports, and open access journal articles, as well as media from YouTube, Flickr, Pinterest and structured data from DBPedia, Wikipedia etc.</h3></p>
                          
                          <h2>Problem</h2>
              <p><h3>The aim here is to support and facilitate the <em>educational (re-)use of informative and multimedia material</em> not originally created for instructional purposes. The challenge is that the majority of data never has a chance to be used as an educational resource. There are two main reasons for this. Firstly it's the sheer volume of data and media available - whether in unstructured form or hard to find, or structured and findable but using vocabularies and knowledge frameworks that are not familiar to educators.</h3></p>
          
                          <h2>Data sets</h2>
              <p><h3>Interesting data sets under this perspective are clearly large informative databases and applications, such as wikipedia, dbpedia, other linked open data sets, Youtube, Twitter hashtags, atlas, etc...</h3></p>

The Company would appreciate some way to ensure that employees could follow a meaningful structure across worthwhile, helpful courses.</h3></p>

                          <p><h3>Under this perspective, a certification is not strictly required, but it would be nice to have some way to track these activities as well.</h3></p>
                          
                          <h2>Problem</h2>
              <p><h3>A plethora of online courses and MOOCs is freely available; learners need to search and select by themselves the ones who seem to better suit their needs. What would be helpful here is a guidance system, i.e. to suggest which course would make sense to take next or to work on simultaneously; and/or basing on own learning/career objectives, previous learning (prerequisites), etc.</h3></p>
          
              <p><h3>Another valuable support would be that of remediation to relearn and reflection. Another useful support would be a kind of formal recording / history of attended MOOC, providing some sort of progression timeline, or updated resume.</h3></p>
          
              <p><h3>The kind of support and guidance described above would be beneficial both for the individual employee’s learning and obviously, in turn, the Company itself.</h3></p>

                          <h2>Data sets</h2>
              <p><h3>Many institutions and organizations provide MOOCs, such as Coursera, edX, Udacity, etc...</h3></p>
                          
                          <h2>Solutions</h2>
              <p><h3>In respect to this use case, we look forward for your proposals for support and guidance across MOOCs and OERs, i.e. to suggest which course would make sense to take next, or to work on simultaneously, basing on:<br />

                          </ul><br />
                          <br />Furthermore, we are also interested in more crowd-based search and structuring facilities of existing offerings (journals, conferences, books, etc…) and new online tools.</h3></p>
