<h3><b>AGRIS – exploiting bibliographic records to create rich Linked Open Data page</b></h3>
<p><h3><i> Fabrizio Celli </i></h3></p>
<p><h3>Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) (Italy)</h3></p>
<p><h3>Open Track</h3></p>
<p><h3> AGRIS is a lot of things; it is a network, a website, a search engine. But AGRIS is also a database, a collection of more than 7.6 million bibliographic references in the agricultural domain. Most of these references are enhanced by the Agrovoc thesaurus and this is very important, since Agrovoc is the magic which allows AGRIS to automatically read specific data sources from the Web.  AGRIS serves a million pages a month, with more than 350,000 users accessing the system every month. AGRIS is also an RDF-aware system, but for the end user it is simply a single entry point to the information in the agricultural domain. This does not mean that AGRIS will centralize all the information in agriculture, but it relies on a central repository and, using a distributed approach, it can access external data sources. What we want to show to the user is the bibliographic record together with a lot of other meaningful information about the topic of the record. This information must be automatically extracted from the Web (using LOD technologies): here comes Agrovoc, which gives semantic meaning to records and can be used to query external sparql endpoints or webservices to get information.</h3></p>

 <h3><b>ASSESS – Automatic Generation of Tests Using Linked Data</b></h3>
<p><h3><i>Lorenz Bühmann, Ricardo Usbeck and Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo</i></h3></p>
<p><h3>AKSW Research Group (Germany)</h3></p>
<p><h3>Open Track</h3></p>
<p><h3>The Linked Open Data Cloud is a gold mine for educational applications: First, it contains knowledge of encyclopedic nature on a large number of real-world entities. Moreover, the data being structured ensures that the meaning of the data can be understood by both humans and machines. Finally, the openness of the data and the use of RDF as standard format facilitate the development of applications that can be ported across different domains with ease. However, RDF is still unknown to most members of the target audience of educational applications. Thus, Linked Data has commonly been used for the description or annotation of educational data. Yet, Linked Data has (to the best of our knowledge) never been used as direct source of educational material. With ASSESS, we demonstrate that Linked Data can be used as source for the automatic generation of educational material. By using innovative RDF verbalization and entity summarization technology, we bridge between natural language and RDF. We then use RDF data directly to generate quizzes which encompass questions of different types on user-defined domains of interest. By these means, we enable learners to generate self-assessment tests on domains of interest. Teachers are supported through the automatic generation and evaluation of tests. Our evaluation shows that ASSESS scales on very large knowledge bases such as DBpedia.<h3></p>

<h3><b>DBLPXplorer: Interactive Graphical Interfaces for the Computer Science Bibliography</b></h3>
<p><h3><i>Ricardo Kawase, Ujwal Gadiraju and Patrick Siehndel</i></h3></p>
<p><h3>L3S Research Center &amp; Leibniz Universität Hannover (Germany)</h3></p>
<p><h3>Open Track</h3></p>
<p><h3>Every year thousands of new research works are indexed and published online. Scientific publications involve mainly two sets of actors; namely, authors and articles. Consequently, a huge tangle of relations emerge together, where authors collaborate with several other authors and articles reference past literature. Due to this complex network, keeping up to date with the latest research in a particular field is often a time consuming task. Currently, available tools to explore such information are solely text based. The information seeker has to search, browse and navigate page by page in order to find relevant research. Yet, one cannot harness an overview of underlying networks and connections. At the same time, there is an abundance of information in the form of nearly disjoint datasets relevant to research and the actors involved in the Linked Open Data cloud. To facilitate the exploration of authors, scientific research and relations, we propose a visual exploratory interface for DBLP Computer Science Bibliography. To further enrich the data we extract authors' keywords from the articles and additionally annotate each article with identified DBPedia entities. The presentation layer consists of several user friendly exploratory interfaces that utilize state of the art javascript library D3 (Data-Driven Documents). Our interfaces include overview of particular venues, authors' profiles, scientific articles, relations and a knowledge base of keywords and semantic annotations. To complete our work, we expose all the enriched data as linked data.</h3></p>

<h3><b>ELARS: E-Learning Activities Recommender System</b></h3>
<p><h3><i>Martina Holenko Dlab, Natasa Hoic-Bozic, Vedran Mornar and Vedran Miletic</i></h3></p>
<p><h3>University of Rijeka (Croatia)</h3></p>
<p><h3>Open Track</h3></p>
<p><h3>ELARS is a recommender system that supports collaborative e-learning activities in an online learning environment that consists of a learning management system (LMS) and different Web 2.0 tools. The recommendations for students and groups include four different types of items: optional e-learning activities, collaborators (colleague students), Web 2.0 tools and advice.</h3></p>
<p><h3>
One of the most important characteristics used for generating recommendations is the activity level. Student’s (group’s) activity level represents quantity and continuity of student’s (group's) contributions in individual and group-based learning activities. It is calculated using available data from third party services, precisely Web 2.0 tools used for realization of e-tivities. Data regarding student's actions is retrieved via APIs or RSS, using adapters implemented for services that are part of the e-learning environment. Based on quantitative analysis of gathered activity traces, student's activity level is estimated relatively to others participants (class or group members). In case of group-based activity, group activity level is also estimated relatively to other groups. Besides for generating recommendations, activity level estimation is useful for teachers as well, especially in the process of evaluating the quantitative aspect of student's engagement in a e-learning activity.</h3></p>

<p><h3>Open Track</h3></p>
<p><h3>LODStories is an engaging application where people learn about art while constructing multimedia stories about art and its connections to the people, places and ideas. LODStories mines the Linked Open Data cloud to discover interesting connections between entities that people are familiar with and artworks, artists and places. LODStories guides users to construct a storyboard that connects the entities in an interesting way. It then fetches text, images and videos that users can arrange to create a multimedia story, and finally constructs a narrated video that users can edit and then publish to tell their story. The process is fun, and students learn about art and its connection to the world they live in. The paper describes the architecture of the system and the algorithms to make the exploration entertaining and educational. </h3></p><p><h3>

<p><h3>Learning English vocabulary is usually a pain for non-native speakers. One way to simplify the process is to use different kinds of material to explain word meanings instead of text-only information, and show the relation of a word / phrase to others. There are fairly large amount of open data can be used for this task, including WordNet, DBpedia, CC-Credit, etc. A functioning prototype has been built to help people get word meanings and illustrate the idea of multimedia dictionary.</h3></p>

<p><h3>Learning materials in most of today’s online learning platforms are siloed and disconnected. Rhizi is web software to deepen the online connections between learning materials with meaning and context. It is a “WordPress” for knowledge-graphs that enables users to freely make connections between a paragraph from a blog, research data, a video segment, people and more. 
These connections are special:  They can be shared with your community, peer-reviewed, visualized, “followed”, and contain explorable context understood by both man and machine.
Open source, open data and free, Rhizis are built collaboratively and empower communities, students, educators, researchers, and governments to create, share, and explore open learning materials in new ways.</h3></p><p><h3>
Rhizi.net can be used for many different education methods, our first use case is with edX and the French FUN platform, but can be used as an additional layer to any Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) system. These annotations are accessible to course participants and supply insight and context to the learning materials. We provide open analytics so both teacher and student can see where students interact, and which concepts discussed.</h3></p><p><h3>

<p><h3>Discharge letters are important issues to consider when ensuring patient safety as they represent the transfer of patient care from one care-giver to another in a time of particular risk for medical errors. Nowadays, paper based letters, unstructured texts, unstandardized diagnosis, language barriers, incompleteness and ambiguity make discharge letters a breakpoint in the clinical information workflow that must be addressed. This paper presents the "Electronic Discharge Letter (eDL) mobile app" as a revolutionary approach to transfer eDLs and prevent the above-mentioned complications. A seamless exchange between doctors, specialists and patients is technically supported by the app through the Near Field Communication standards. To achieve semantic interoperability, the eDL app combines the CLAS scale for discharge letters with nine clinical terminologies and linked data sources. It encourages the adoption of a handover standard and the integration with healthcare systems. In addition, the eDL app contributes to patient empowerment by offering multilingual definitions and translations of clinical concepts from terminology/ontology mappings rather than text-based searches. It automatically raises allergy alerts based on current prescriptions and previous diagnosis, all of which will ultimately improve the continuity of care, and simplify doctors' workflow and patient decisions. The app potential for mobile learning in healthcare settings should be also considered. </h3></p>
