<p><h3>TechCube, Scottish Government, Edinburgh, UK</h3></p>
<p><h3>Our coursefinder app is a searchable map of every available course from Elementary level all the way to University. The data was compiled from multiple incomplete sources and government agencies, and merged into a simplified and complete dataset. <br />

Learners can search through the dataset by subject, institution name, postcode, qualification type or SCQF level. Results are displayed on a map with a tool tip for more information and a web link to the institution home page. <br />

This is the first time in Scottish history this type of information has been made publicly available, despite a number of official attempts.<h3></p>

<p><h3>Université Claude Bernard Lyon and LIRIS laboratory (Lyon France)</h3></p>
<p><h3>DataConf is a mobile Web application that allows browsing conference publications, their authors, authors organizations, and even authors other publications or publications related to the same keywords. It queries a main SPARQL endpoint that serves the conference metadata set, as well as other endpoints and Web services to enrich and explore these data. This application exploits the Linked Data paradigm and performs client-side reasoning. It follows recent W3C technical advances and as a full client-side mashup, requires few server resources. It can easily be configured and deployed for any conference with available metadata on the Web. Its component-based architecture also allows developing extensions that query new data sources. We also propose several custom data sources that allow managing conference events, linking authors and publications to other resources on the Web and locally handling the conference keyword ontology.<h3></p>

<p><h3>The game begins with a central concept, say a drug, that needs to be 'guessed' by the player. Unless the player possesses unexplained guessing potential, they have to expand the concept and reveal some of the hints related with it. The hints might either be other concepts (like a disease targeted by the drug) or a simple property of the original concept (like a brand name). The related concepts can, in turn, be expanded and soon an exciting knowledge network is developed. </h3></p>
<p><h3><As resources are always limited, the player has to exchange some genetic material in order to reveal the hints. Nevertheless, a correct geuss is rewarded with loads of genetic material! The palyer then has to spend the genetic material in the most effective manner: reveal the least information possible to make guessing easier.<h3></p>

We have used a sample of 30 multimedia lessons. At first stage, we parsed the internal format and retrieved text attached to each page. Next, we applied a combination of entity-recognition algorithms and web crawling to fetch additional materials. Sources are mostly dbpedia and Encyclopaedia of Life (eol.org). As a result, we enriched the original multimedia application with additional links and images. When user moves accross pages of a lesson, links on the right change to reflect the content.<h3></p>

<p><h3>Globe-Town.org opens up the successes and the challenges of sustainable development around the world and what they mean for you, through a fun and informative web application built from open data. With it, you can explore the intersections, tensions and trade-offs between the 'three pillars' of sustainable development: the environment, the economy and society. In particular, Globe-Town shows how no one is isolated from the consequences of climate change in an interdependent world, and how responding to it presents a world of opportunities to inspire individuals and entrepreneurs. In order to tackle the big challenges of sustainability, people of all ages need to learn how they affect us personally and what we can do about them. Globe-Town does this by connecting the global with the local, so we can explore the risks, responsibilities and opportunities in an increasingly interconnected world. Globe-Town won a top three place at the first international #Apps4Climate competition, held by the World Bank and judged by the chair of the UNFCC, Christiana Figueres.<h3></p>

In knownodes, the connections between knowledge resources are centers for social interaction and combine together to generate a virtual network of knowledge resources, and user generated content such as ideas and open questions.
</h3></p><p><h3>Knowledge could be made easier to access by providing context to the knowledge around us. As well as serving as a collaborative, peer-reviewed curative platform of learning resources, state-of-the-art open research questions, and rich media(video, image, text, animation, games)
</h3></p><p><h3>The platform is open source, free and user-friendly.
This proof of concept prototype demonstrates how anyone can easily create connections between wikipedia articles to learning resources and explore knowledge via a graph and list interface. We have also prototyped wikipedia api integration for easy retrieval of wikipedia articles.
Next steps in our roadmap, is to apply a peer-review system, support for further apis for publications and OER and make information in the system available through a browser extension.<h3></p>

</h3></p>
<p><h3> Currently, the Learner Journey Navigation System is a linked data mash-up that illustrates how a learner can be helped to find her way through learning opportunities and resources when outcomes are published as URIs.
The mash-up takes Scotland's Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) and publishes it via the Achievement Standards Network (ASN) linked data platform. With this infrastructure, it is possible to compare a learner's interests and achievements, as recorded in an e-portfolio, with the curriculum data in the ASN in order to suggest career goals, as well as learning pathways to reaching them. Scottish Qualification Authority college data is used to suggest relevant courses nearby. A query in the Intralibrary digital content repository suggests relevant learning resources, while a controlled query in a social network suggests people who are or have been on similar journeys. <h3></p><p><h3>
With further development, the underlying linked data infrastructure could enable an unlimited number of other apps via generic web APIs provided by the ASN. Nor is the infrastructure limited to school curriculae. Other competency structures can also be URI-ified and used to support the "Teaching going social", "Educationizer", and "Supporting employees‚ development via didactic guidance through learning materials" LinkedUp Challenge use cases.

<h3><b>MELOD: Mobile Environment for learning with Linked Open Data<b></h3>
<p><h3><i>Marco Arrigo, Giovanni Fulantelli and Davide Taibi</i></h3></p>
<p><h3>National Research Council of Italy - Institute for Educational Technologies, Palermo, Italy</h3></p>
<p><h3>The MELOD environment has been designed to support, through the use of mobile devices, the informal learning experiences that take place during the visit of a city. In the last few years, many applications for mobile devices have been developed with the aim of supporting students during a visit experience. One of the main difficulties in designing and managing these applications is related to the content, since usually it must be prepared in advance by the teachers, and maintained during the lifespan of the application, thus requiring an extra effort to organize the information for mobile devices and also to maintain the content updated. MELOD exploits the huge amount of dataset in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud to overcome the previous issues, by providing contextualized updated information based on students' location. The MELOD environment interlinks the DBpedia, Europeana and Geonames datasets with the contextual information of the students' learning experience. Finally, students social activities, like voting and commenting, are also used to feed new knowledge into the MELOD environment.<h3></p>

<p><h3> Mismuseos.net shows a case of consumption and use of Linked Data from museums and their valorisation in education, through innovative end-user applications, like facet-based searches, semantic context creation and navigation through graphs, which drastically improve user experience. The search engine enables aggregated searches by different facets and summarization of results for each successive search. The solution is built on GNOSS, a semantic and social software platform. </h3></p>
<p><h3>
Our proposal consists of building a Museums Micro Cloud of Linked, Clean and Curated Data with an underlying Specialized and Unified Graph; and secondly, in connecting cultural and educational worlds in a knowledge ecosystem. This poses a particular problem of ontological engineering that we have addressed: the problem of building Hybrid Ontologies or extended ontologies.<h3></p>

<p><h3>Massive Open Online Courses are becoming very relevant in the current scope of education. One of the weaknesses presented by current MOOC platforms is the lack of detailed and structured information about the learning outcomes achieved with the course. Moocrank is our proposal to solve this issue by combining open data about learning outcomes and data obtained from the main MOOC platforms (Coursera, Edx, Udacity). A user of Moocrank is able to:
1. define his/her learning objectives
2. obtain course recommendations based on those objectives
3. once he/she completes a course, he/she can provide feedback about the learning outcomes achieved with it<h3></p>

<p><h3>Students of media and communication sciences study the role of media in our society. They frequently search through media archives to manually select items that cover a certain event. When this is done for large time spans and across media-outlets, this task can however be challenging and laborious. Therefore, up until now the focus of students has been on manual and qualitative analyses of newspaper coverage. PoliMedia aims to stimulate and facilitate large-scale, cross-media analysis of the coverage of political events. We focus on the meetings of the Dutch parliament, and provide automatically generated links between the transcripts of those meetings, newspaper articles, including their original lay-out on the page, and radio bulletins. Via the portal at www.polimedia.nl students will be able to search through the debates and find related media coverage in two media-outlets, facilitating a more efficient search process and qualitative analyses of the media coverage. Furthermore, the generated links are available via a SPARQL endpoint, allowing quantitative analyses with complex, structured queries that are not covered by the search functionality of the portal, thus challenging the student to go across the academic borders and enter fields that previously have been neglected.<h3></p><p><h3>

<h3><b>Social VLE With Rich Structure Learning Data Using Semantic CMS<b></h3>
<p><h3><i>Abdulaziz Aldaej and Paul Krause</i></h3></p>
<p><h3>University of Surrey, Guildford, UK</h3></p>
<p><h3>After the arrival of the web in the 1990s, educational institutions started to maintain their learning materials within Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs), as the Internet is a significant source of material for many students and teachers. However, there has been less development in the current VLEs in the past few years, which remain heavily centred on single institutions even though the web has been developing (e.g., web 2, web3). There is a clear need to integrate VLEs with the wider and social Web. In our research we have prototyped a simple VLE that makes use of Schema.org and the Semantic Content Management System (SCMS) Drupal to provide a more open, social and linked learning environment. Essentially, we aim to use semantic web technology, basically Linked Data, to develop and enhance VLEs by improving the searching for the learning resources, supporting dynamic content composition for e-Learning services and integrating social networking and media. This paper will introduce and show the specification of our VLE that is still under development.<h3></p>

<h3><b><img src="images/trophy.png" height="200px" align="right" />We-Share: a social annotation application that publishes and retrieves information about educational ICT tools from the Web of Data - SHORTLISTED - 3rd PRIZE<b></h3>

<p><h3>Several educational registries (e.g. Schoolforge or Ontoolsearch) provide information about ICT tools in order to help educators when discovering and -which limits their utility- is how their data is sustained, since educational descriptions of ICT tools are hard to create and maintain updated. In order to overcome this problem, some registries (e.g. Cool Tools For Schools) involve their communities of users in their sustainment, following a social approach. Unfortunately, three important drawbacks can be found in these registries: first, the well-known cold-start problem is present; second, their data models can not typically describe information about the educational use of ICT tools; third, these registries are isolated data silos that need to create and keep updated all the data they manage, thus increasing the overall effort of sustaining educational ICT tool datasets. For this reason we propose We-Share, a social annotation application that allows educators to search, create and enrich descriptions of ICT tools from the Web of Data. This characteristic enables We-Share to count with an initial dataset of 6760 ICT tool descriptions automatically gathered from the Web, which are automatically updated by periodically crawling the Web of Data. Further, We-Share enables the community of educators to enrich its dataset reviewing ICT tools and relating them to the educational contexts where they were employed. All the data published on We-Share is available as Linked Open Data.

 <h3><b>yourHistory: Personalising Historic Events - SHORTLISTED<b></h3>
<p><h3><i>Maria-Hendrike Peetz, David Graus, Daan Odijk, Maarten de Rijke and  Ork de Rooij</i></h3></p>
<p><h3>University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands</h3></p>
<p><h3>Students of history often study dates and events that have little to do with their own life. We make history tangible by showing historic events that are personal and based on a user's own interests (his or her Facebook profile). Often, those events are small-scale and escape history books. By linking personal historic events with global events, we aim to link a user's life with global history, in some way allow him to writing his own personal history book.</h3></p>
<p><h3>We represent a user's Facebook profile as a bag of concepts, by extracting raw text from a profile and applying state-of-the-art entity linking techniques. By leveraging the structured nature of DBPedia we extract historic event entities; these belong to the Event class, or are entities with a startDate-predicate that are not of class Person. We map the DBPedia entities to their corresponding Wikipedia pages. To generate a user's personal timeline, we match his profile entities to the events by applying a variety of similarity metrics. The final selection of historic events a user is presented with is realized through a mix of the user's personal profile, the time spans of his own and, if known, his parents lives, and statistical properties concerning the events. The events in the global history are based on the timeline of modern history available through DBPedia.<h3></p>
